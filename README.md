## 🛰️ Overview

**RayBridge** is an off-grid monitoring and visualization system designed to pair a
**Raspberry Pi** with an **Orbic device running Rayhunter**.

It provides a clear, always-on operational view via:
- A web dashboard
- A dedicated LCD dashboard for field deployment
- Continuous system health and connectivity awareness

RayBridge is built for **portable, low-connectivity, and security-focused environments**.
